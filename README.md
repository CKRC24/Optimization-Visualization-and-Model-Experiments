# Optimization visualization & model experiments

In this project, we conducted some experiments about **Model Structures**, **Optimization**, and **Generalization**.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisite & Toolkits

The following are some toolkits and their version you need to install for running this project

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) - The Python version used
* [Pytorch 0.3](http://pytorch.org/) - Deep Learning for Python

In addition, it is required to use **GPU** to run this project.

## Running the tests

The following are some instructions to reproduce the results of the model.

### Training/Testing Dataset

We used the dataset of **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** for our tasks.

### Source Codes & Report

To see our model structures, you can find the code in the folder and further explainations in our **Report.pdf**.

### Reproducing results

To reproduce the results, run codes in the following format:

```
python3 HW1-X_X.py
```

Images will output into the folder.
